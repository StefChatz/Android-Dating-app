# Description
This project is a Tinder-like app. It has 10 predefined users associated with markers on the map. The application gets the user, using the device and creates a marker on the map so he can be identified between the predefined users. Also, the app's user can only see people that are within a 1km range to them and the app will allow only those in that defined range to be available for rating. The application creates and then saves the predefined users on a firebase database along with their names and latitude and longitude. On the top of the screen, appears a button that when pressed allows the user to see the other user's card/profiles. Moreover, should the user's location be changed, the device should be restarted, since it is not a completely functional tinder and the ranking part of the program is just a demonstration, that the tracking of the other users present in the application. For example, if the user is in the University of Surrey he will be able to swipe all of the users within a 1km range, but, when the location is changed and the application is restarted in a location, 1km away, it will not diplay those not within 1km of the user. 

# Conclusion
Overall, in my opinion the app is beutifully structured with decent quality graphics and the simplicity of the gestures make it quite user friendly, on top of including a great functionality.
